                        <p>In 1992, the Chamber of Secrets was re-opened by Ron's younger sister Ginny, 
                            under the influence of a diary written by Riddle. The diary allowed Riddle's memory 
                            to possess Ginny, allowing him to act through her to open the Chamber a second time.
                            Lucius Malfoy, through the desire to further the power of the Dark Lord, had slipped 
                            the diary into her bundle of schoolbooks, without knowing it was a Horcrux. His ulterior 
                            motive was to ruin the reputations of several great wizards, including Albus Dumbledore 
                            and Arthur Weasley, the latter of whom was highly influential concerning the Muggle Protection Act. 
                            However, Harry discovered the truth and destroyed the diary and the basilisk, thus bringing an end 
                            to these dark plots. </p>
