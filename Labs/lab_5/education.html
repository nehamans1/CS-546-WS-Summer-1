                        <h3>Undergraduate</h3>
                        <p>First university that I went to is University of Melbourne in Australia. It is one of
                        the leading universities in Australia for Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
                        I obtained the Computer Engineering and Computer Science undergradaute degree from there.
                        There isn't any one favorite class I have from that time. I enjoyed many courses there.
                        Staying over night in computer labs finishing programming assignments is a painful
                        but also memorable experience I have from that time. </p>

                        <h3>Post Graduate</h3>
                        <p>Second university that I went to is RMIT University in Australia. It is located in Melbourne
                        and has several campuses in the Melbourne city center.
                        I obtained a Graduate Certificate in Supply Chain and Logistics from there.
                        There isn't any one favorite class I have from that time. I enjoyed all the four courses I studied
                        in the graduate certificate. The presentation my team and I gave after a field trip
                        to Mars distribution centre is one of the memorable memories I have from that program </p>

                        <p>Third university that I am attending is Stevens Institute of Technology in USA. It is located in Hoboken, NJ.
                        It is one of the leading engineering schools on the East Coast. I am studying the Business Intelligence and Analytics
                        program at Stevens. Currently Web Programming is my favourite class in school. The talk by the Chief Data Scientist at
                        Dun and Bradstreet in school is one of the memorable experiences I have had at school.
